Why does the Material class have its own Shade method?

- I think that what we do is we call RayIntersect on the spheres and in that method, we record the local surface normal and hit point in hitInfo
- In Color getPixelColor called after shootRay (using the hitInfo), we pass the ray and hitInfo, and we transform the hitPoint and surfaceNormal into world space.
- Still make sure to record depth info

In this method:
Variables needed:
- Vec3 going toward camera
- Vec3 goong toward light
- Surface normal

Shade everything in world space
